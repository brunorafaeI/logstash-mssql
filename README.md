### What is logstash?

Logstash is a tool for managing events and logs. When used generically, the term encompasses a larger system of log collection, processing, storage and searching activities.

The classic definition of Logstash says itâ€™s an open-source, server-side data processing pipeline that can simultaneously ingest data from a wide variety of sources, then parse, filter, transform and enrich the data, and finally forward it to a downstream system.

### How logstash works?

Data flows through a Logstash pipeline in three stages: the input stage, the filter stage, and the output stage.
In each stage, there are plugins that perform some action on the data.

This is shown in the image below.
